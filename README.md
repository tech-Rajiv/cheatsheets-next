# cheatsheets-next
Hello , everyone I'am documenting my Learnings here. the points that i think should be noted will be added here. so the purpose of this repo is clear : To only refer in future on important area that need revisions.

1. # Not make api/route when using Nextjs if possible:
   because that makes client - request ur nextjs server - then your nextjs server again calls your own api-route then response is send to clent - can u see the problem
   # Instead use SeverActions or ServerComponets
