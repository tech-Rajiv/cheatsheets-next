# 📘 Cheatsheets — Next.js

Hello everyone!
I'm documenting my learnings here.
Anything important points about ***Nextjs*** that I think needs revision will be added in this repo.

The goal is simple:
✅ A quick reference for important concepts I want to revisit in the future.



# 👉 Next wants to know your components
* Every coomponents has to have type example 'use client' or 'use server', by default if you donot provide anything it is considered as 'use server' server-components
* In Reactjs we cannot do async components, but next can do , so we can call db and make async component take that data and generate html css js in server and serve that response
```jsx
async function getUser() {
  return user;    // db call
}

// 2) Async Server Component
export default async function Page() {
  const user = await getUser();  // call server function

  return (
    <main>render here</main>
  );
}
```
* In React we can do waterfall effect, using useEffect but not this async function.

# 👉 Avoid Creating Unnecessary API Routes in Next.js
* Calling your own API route from your own Next.js server is unnecessary overhead.
* Example: Client → Next.js Server → Your API Route → Response (all inside same app).
* Prefer using **Server Actions**, **Server Components**, or **direct DB calls** from server code.
* Only use **Route Handlers** when you truly need an API endpoint (e.g., external clients).

# 👉 Rendering key points
Next.js does NOT automatically make your route a static site (SSG) or build-time HTML just because you didn’t use "use client".
### **The default is: “Server Component with Static Rendering (unless data decides otherwise)”**
Meaning:
- If your page has **no dynamic data**, yes → it becomes **SSG**. Server Component + no dynamic fetch = SSG
- If your page imports `fetch()` with default caching → it also becomes **SSG**. Server Component + fetch() with default caching = SSG
- If your page uses **`fetch(..., { cache: 'no-store' })`** → it becomes **SSR**.  Fetch with cache: "no-store" = SSR
- Fetch with { next: { revalidate: X } } = ISR
- If your page uses **cookies, headers, dynamic route params**, etc. → it becomes **SSR**.
- `"use client"` only makes the component run on browser — it does **not** affect SSG/SSR.
If your component uses:
- `cookies()`
- `headers()`
- `searchParams`
- dynamic `params`
- database queries inside the component
- `unstable_noStore()`
**5. Using dynamic things like above makes the route SSR**
  
# 👉 cookies
* In browser-initiated first requests, we cannot add custom headers (like tokens) because the browser sends them automatically.
* CSR apps (React) work fine because user-specific authenticated requests happen *after* JS loads and can read `localStorage`.
* SSR apps (Next.js) must know the user **before rendering HTML**, so they cannot rely on `localStorage`.
* Cookies are automatically sent on every request, including the very first, making them perfect for SSR auth.
* Because cookies auto-send, they introduce CSRF risk — a malicious site can trigger requests using your cookies.
* Use **SameSite=Lax** for safe defaults: cookies allowed on normal navigation but blocked on cross-site POST requests (prevents CSRF).
* Use **SameSite=Strict** is most secure but breaks login when arriving from external sites. banks ussualy use this.
* Use **HttpOnly** cookies to prevent frontend JS from reading or modifying the cookie (protects against XSS).
* `expiry: <seconds>` sets how long the cookie is valid.
* Your browser stores cookies from every website you visit, but… Each website gets its own private cookie storage.
*  facebook.com -	fb_session, google.com - g_session, yourapp.com	token - refresh-token. They cannot read each other's cookies.
*  When you open example.com, the browser looks at:
*  domain matches	cookie domain must match request domain
*  path matches	/api cookie won’t be sent to /auth
*  secure=true	only sent on HTTPS
*  sameSite=Lax/Strict	controls cross-site sending
*  If rules match → browser autosends only those cookies with the request.

# 👉 params / urls

* in server components to get url parmas, if url is appurl/magic-link?token=xyz , so app/magic-link/page.jsx code:
```jsx
export default async function Page({ searchParams }) {
  const { token } = await searchParams;
  return <h1>Token : {token}</h1>
}
```
* In clint do this,
```jsx
import { useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";

export default function Page() {
  const search = useSearchParams();
  const token = search.get("token");
  console.log("TOKEN → ", token);
  return <div>Verifying...</div>;
}
```

# 👉 Rate limiters & IPs
* The basic idea of rate limiting algorithms is simple. At the high-level, we need a counter to keep track of how many requests are sent from the same user, IP address, etc. If the counter is larger than the limit, the request is disallowed.
* Where shall we store counters? Using the database is not a good idea due to slowness of disk access. In-memory cache is chosen because it is fast and supports time-based expiration strategy.
* For instance, Redis [11] is a popular option to implement rate limiting. It is an in-memory store that offers two commands: INCR and EXPIRE.
* INCR: It increases the stored counter by 1.
* EXPIRE: It sets a timeout for the counter. If the timeout expires, the counter is automatically deleted.

```jsx
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const { username } = await request.json();
    const key = `attempt:${username}`;
    const attempt = await redis.incr(key);
    if (attempt === 1) {
      await redis.expire(key, 60); // infirst attempt
    }
    if (attempt <= 5) {
      return NextResponse.json({
        msg: "you request accepted successfully",
        attempt,
      });
    } else {
      return NextResponse.json(
        {
          msg: `too many attempts please try after some time - attempt${attempt}`,
        },
        { status: 429 }
      );
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { message: "Internal server error" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```
* The client sends a request to rate limiting middleware.
* Rate limiting middleware fetches the counter from the corresponding bucket in Redis and checks if the limit is reached or not.
* If the limit is reached, the request is rejected.
* If the limit is not reached, the request is sent to API servers. Meanwhile, the system increments the counter and saves it back to Redis.
* ttl key in redis return remaining time of expriy of the key so it can used at time of rejecion as response to wait till this time.
```jsx
if (attempt === 1) await redis.expire(key, 60);

    if (attempt > 10) {
      const ttl = await redis.ttl(key);
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: `Too many requests. Try again in ${ttl}s` },
        { status: 429 }
      );
    }
```
* Ideally we should do this in middleware, so create a middleware that runs only on api/ routes
```jsx
export const config = {
  matcher: "/api/:path*",
};
```
* Because there would be another middleware which will check in navigate , route calling etc about token so these two are diiferent , ratelimitter should be used to stop api/callings
* We can access IP of user and can limit that, in Nextjs middleware we can do req.ip
* But in node js runtime we need to get headers , so we do
```jsx
   const ip = req.ip ||req.headers.get("x-forwarded-for")?.split(",")[0] ||"unknown";
```
* This guarantees correct IP everywhere.

# 👉 Protecting access : Industry uses one of these patterns
* Pattern A: Protect pages with middleware.
* Pattern B: Protect server components using getServerSession, This is used inside layout, page, RSC, server actions:
```jsx
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
if (!session) redirect("/login");
```
* Pattern C: Protect API routes
```jsx
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
if (!session) return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });

```

# 👉 Middlwares
* Middleware runs on Edge → cannot read request body, DB, or modify headers. Edge runtime has limits:
* You can:
✔️ Read cookies
✔️ Read next-auth JWT (token)
✔️ Redirect
✔️ Protect routes
* so an middleware with next-auth looks like this
```jsx
import withAuth from "next-auth/middleware";

export default withAuth({
  callbacks: {
    authorized: ({ token }) => !!token,
  },
});

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/dashboard/:path*", "/user/:path*"],
};

```
* Notice how i use withAuth fn which is by next-auth and helps to redirect is not authorized


# 👉 ARCHITECTURE to render user specific data

 1️⃣ Default (Preferred)
* Use Server Components to fetch user and render page.
RSC → getServerSession() → fetch DB → return JSX

2️⃣ Client Components (when required)
* Use session from client for interaction, then server action for data.
Client → useSession() → serverAction → return data

 3️⃣ Hybrid (very common)
* Server component fetches user data initially →
* Client component hydrates UI for interactivity.
RSC (initial load) → Client (interactive updates)
* This is simply parent server comp just fetch data and render a client comp with sending data as props.
